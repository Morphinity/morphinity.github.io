My primary intention for setting up and using this blog is to share my experiences with technology that I use and build, my learnings and thoughts about works of science, art and life in general\. I certainly wish that these posts help someone save time and effort while giving them new insights\. The other intention of course, being a humble geek, is to fulfill the cliched but necessary obligation of having an online presence!

This blog is powered by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), both of which fit in perfectly with my need to create a simple clean site, with no fancy layouts and a small learning curve to setup the requisites\.

As I finished watching *Mad Men* last week, I feel compelled to share the words of wisdom imparted to *Don Draper* as he finally finds peace and happiness in accepting the self \-
