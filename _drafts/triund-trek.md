__Experience__ <br>
*December 12* <br>
As told by the locals that fresh snow fall had blocked the track half way, the ten of us decided to trek till that point and return. Considering only half the trek, we decided to move from our hotel at 10:30am (not the wisest decision of the day). As we followed the sign boards, we reached the point where the trek starts and collectively decided to take a cab till Gallu Temple. It was much later into the trek that we realized that taking the cab to Gallu Temple and saving first 2-3kms of the track was worth. That stretch is more or less a road and the really hard and beautiful part of the trek starts after Gallu temple. If we hadn\'t taken the cab, there was no way we could reach the top and come back on the same day.

Except for a few steep, narrow and stony patches the first 2-3kms isn\'t really hard. Snow started appearing almost after 2kms and we got some really nice views at the bends and corners of the track. As we kept moving, it became difficult to have a good grip on the track, thanks to the melting snow. About half way in the trek the snow was almost half feet deep and melting all along the width of the track. As a result 4 of us decided to return back from Moon View Cafe which is half way along the track. The rest of us decided that we would keep moving as long as we can and return only if it becomes completely impossible to trek, which we all knew inside our heads wasn\'t going to happen. The track got narrower and steep really quickly with snow melting everywhere we stepped. When the cold water filled up my really old sport shoes, I remember cursing myself for not being prepared with proper trekking shoes to provide grip on the snow. I remember slipping several times on the track, barely a feet away from the edge. Always wear trekking shoes on a trek. Always.

For major part of the second half, we were being guided by the shoe steps in the snow as it was almost 1 foot deep now. We decided to come back the same day instead of staying the night on the top and so we had to hurry. If it wasn't for the beautiful scenic views up there, we would certainly have given up and returned. But as the snow cover increased, the views kept getting more beautiful and the trek more dangerous. 

The next and the last phase of the trek was the last 2km. The snow depth was close to 2 feet now and we could barely make sense of the track now. It was all snow with shoe marks going in random directions. This was certainly the steepest and the most dangerous part. Surrounded by clouds now, it got really cold really quickly. And then just out of nowhere comes the most wonderful mountain dog who started walking in front of us and guiding us on finding the right direction. I remember that all 6 of us had to stop to take some rest and this dog stopped a few hundred metres ahead of us and when I signalled the dog to come over, it came back running and stood right in front of us. Mountain dogs are simply amazing.
