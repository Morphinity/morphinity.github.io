  description : "<ul>
  				<li>
  					Created MOV file playback support on Android which does not natively support it. For this I built
  					an efficient video/audio sample loader that interacts with decoders in other threads to give a seamless
  					video/audio playback. Built an efficient Thumbnail extractor that can fetch frames for Ultra HD videos. 
  				</li>
  				<li>
	  				Designed and built backend and UX for a video player and an editor that can edit a sequence of 
	  				videos and images. Built features such as trimming, transition between clips, sequence editing, 
	  				lighting filters such as exposure, highlights, shadows, audio controls etc.
  				</li>
				<li>
					Designed internal data models for Projects and Sequence of media files. 
					Created framework for interaction between UI, playback and rendering threads on Android.
				</li>
				<li>
					Built an efficient Rendering pipeline that applies filters to frames on the fly during video playback. 
					Built a single shader in OpenGL that implements several filters by loading LUT (Lookup Table) data in 
					an intelligent way.

- name : "Adobe - Media Grouping Algorithm"
  description : "<ul>
  				<li>
  					Intention of the algorithm was to group a user\'s media files in a way such that those groups represent
  					memories and events in user\'s life. Each memory or event can have further sub-memories and sub-events.
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					The algorithm analyzes media metadata and groups the files recursively for navigation. 
  					The algorithm uses time and optionally location (prediction is done if unavailable) to build a 
  					tree of user\'s media files. Built data structures to efficiently fetch information of a node representing an
  					event.
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					Built client-server interface to fetch the groups and designed a 
  					database to hold result data.

- name : "Adobe ATL - Customer Lifetime Value"
  description : "<ul>
  					<li>
  						At Adobe ATL (Advanced Technology Labs), I identified the current research landscape 
  						on the business metric called Customer Lifetime Value, came up with and solved a 
  						challenging problem. 
  					</li>
  					<li>
				  		Current mathematical models for CLV use several customer parameters to predict 
						their future profitability. With the growth of user's activity on social media websites, 
						it becomes interesting to see how their activity on social networks can be leveraged to 
						improve these models.
					</li>
					<li>
					   My work revolved around predictive models and machine learning techniques to improve upon 
					   these models and evaluate the profitability of Adobe customers on <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/\"> Behance </a> (social network for creatives).

  description : '<ul>
                  <li>
                      Studied in detail, the mathematics and intuition behind the workings of Kalman Filter.

                  <li>
                      Implemented a filter that inputs GPS navigation data obtained from a ballistic missile containing white
                      gaussian noise and outputs an estimate of the actual smoothened path taken by the missile.
