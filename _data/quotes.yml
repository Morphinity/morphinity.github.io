- quote : "Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. <br/>
           Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. <br/>
           Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? <br/>
           Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God."
  author : "Epicurus"

- quote : "\"The true value of man is not determined by his possession, supposed or real, of Truth, but rather by 
			his sincere exertion to get to the Truth. It is not possession of Truth by which he extends his powers 
			and in which his ever-growing perfectability is to be found. Possession makes one passive, indolent and
			proud. If God were to hold all Truth concealed in his right hand, and in his left only the steady and 
			diligent drive for Truth, albeit with the proviso that I would always and forever err in the process, 
			and to offer me the choice, I would with all humility take the left hand.\""

- quote : "Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. 
			Their result is absolutely nil. They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions 
			that have a certain charm for the weak.... They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they 
			have no account."
